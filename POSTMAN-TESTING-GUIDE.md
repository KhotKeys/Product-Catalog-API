## ðŸ”§ Common Postman Configuration Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot POST" or "Cannot GET" Errors
**Solution**: 
- Ensure server is running on port 3002
- Check URL format: `http://localhost:3002/api/v1/...`
- Verify HTTP method is correct

### Issue 2: 400 Bad Request on POST/PUT
**Solution**:
1. Set `Content-Type: application/json` in Headers tab
2. Select "raw" in Body tab
3. Select "JSON" from dropdown (not "Text")
4. Ensure JSON is properly formatted (use JSON validator)

### Issue 3: 404 Not Found for ID-based requests
**Solution**:
- Copy actual ObjectId from previous responses
- Don't use placeholder text like "{categoryId}"
- ObjectIds are 24-character hex strings

### Issue 4: 500 Internal Server Error
**Solution**:
- Check server terminal for detailed error messages
- Ensure required fields are provided
- Verify data types match schema requirements

## ðŸ“‹ Postman Environment Setup (Optional but Recommended)

Create a Postman Environment with these variables:
- `baseUrl`: `http://localhost:3002`
- `apiVersion`: `/api/v1`
- `categoryId`: (update after creating categories)
- `productId`: (update after creating products)

This allows you to use `{{baseUrl}}{{apiVersion}}/categories` instead of full URLs.

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Testing Sequence (7-minute walkthrough)

1. **Setup** (30 seconds): Health check + Seed database
2. **Categories** (2 minutes): Create, list, search, update
3. **Products** (3 minutes): Create with variants, list, filter by category/price, update stock
4. **Reports** (1 minute): Show analytics for products, categories, inventory
5. **Cleanup** (30 seconds): Delete test data

---

## ðŸ“Š Expected Response Codes

- **200 OK**: Successful GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE operations
- **201 Created**: Successful POST operations (creating new resources)
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid data, missing required fields, validation errors
- **404 Not Found**: Resource doesn't exist, invalid ObjectId
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side issues, database connection problems

---

## ðŸš¨ Important Testing Notes

1. **Database Resets**: Memory database resets when server restarts
2. **ObjectId Format**: Use actual 24-character hex IDs from responses
3. **Required Headers**: Always set `Content-Type: application/json` for POST/PUT
4. **Data Relationships**: Categories with products cannot be deleted
5. **Validation**: API enforces required fields and data types
